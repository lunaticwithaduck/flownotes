### "I want to try this out for some not very bright reason how do I set it up?"
1. Clone project
2. Uuuga buuga run ***yarn install*** or ***npm install***
3. How about running the dev script now?
4. Realise this project is very badly written and send me some hate mail ;)))

### Tech Stack of the Project (this info is pretty useless to you but I kinda like how it looks)

- React
- TypeScript
- ReactFlow
- MaterialUI
- Figma
- SCSS

### Tech Stack Might Expand With

- Redux Toolkit / Zustand
- PostgreSQL w/ Prisma
- Socket.io
- AuthZero

### TODO List:
- Add MUI & SCSS Themes
- Add Text Formatting Menu
- Add the Ability to Save Boards (CRUD)
- Add Authentication
- Add Collaboration Feature
- Maybe Add Undo Button??????
